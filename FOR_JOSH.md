Wont know what to do with myself now this is submitted, so theres a good chance in the next few days ill create a 'Version_1_start'
branch for myself to get a head start on the next assignment. Please dont pay any attention to it, don't want to fall foul of any 
"No making changes after the due date" nonsense. The branches master (our final MVP product) and Roshen-Settings
 (see the report for the low down on that - TLDR is there were merge issues so we've left his branch up so you can fiew the pages 
 he worked on in isolation) will be left untouched as of me writing this - 10:10pm 30.9.19.
 
 Cheers - Alex
